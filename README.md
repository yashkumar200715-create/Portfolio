This portfolio represents my journey as a Computer Science Engineering (AI & ML) student.
Here, I share who I am, the skills I’ve learned, and the projects I’ve built to grow as a developer.
My goal is to create meaningful, efficient, and user-friendly solutions while continuously improving my technical abilities.
Thank you for visiting my portfolio — your time means a lot!
